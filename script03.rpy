    unknown "El, it's finished."

    """Lyn Marness is more than ninety years old and hasn't stood at his full height in ten. He was a tower of a man in his prime, two metres tall and built like a boxer. 
    
    Nearly nobody he ever met was able to look him straight in the eye, at least not and tell him \"No\". 
    
    Illness has gradually eaten away at that over the years. He feels as if he lives at the bottom of a deep bath, everybody he ever meets looking down at him from slippery, unscalable walls, none of them able to reach down to help him. 
    
    He's spent his final months crumpled up in bed like a dying spider, changing to a corpse's colour ahead of time. It might have been bearable if he'd lost his mind, but he remembers what he used to be: a leader, a powerhouse. 
    
    He used to be able to alter the course of terrible events for the better, to get justice. He used to protect people."""

    unknown "El. You can wake up now."

    """But there's a warm wind through his thin colourless hair and there's direct sunlight coming down on him now, and the heat is filling him up like a tonic. 
    
    He's outside; it's been too long since he was last outside."""

    """When he opens his eyes he sees his lake, the one in the Northwest which he used to have all to himself every summer. He's on a boat, his boat, lying on a blanket laid on the deck. A few kilometres away behind them is the little lake house, empty.

    It's perfect. He didn't know he had the strength left to safely leave the hospital, let alone travel this far. But if he'd put his mind to it and selected a final moment, this might have been it."""

    unknown "Do you remember me?"

    show marion at offleft

    """Marness looks, with eyes which are strengthening. The woman speaking is seated on the deck beside him, attentive. 
    
    She has a large plastic box full of medical supplies open in front of her, and a light suit jacket laid on the deck beside it, and she has her sleeves rolled up so she can work. 
    
    As he watches, she carefully disposes of a needle."""

    """A dim memory surfaces and starts taking shape. The woman is twice as old now as when he knew her last, and visibly twice as confident. 
    
    It would be difficult to forget her. He taught her everything he— well, everything he could remember at the time. 
    
    He remembers her as a field agent. He remembers sending her through Hell, a fistful of times.""" 
    
    marness "Marion."

    marion """El, you died. You died surrounded by grieving family. They loved you very much, and they cried over you. 
    
    The funeral for the fake is in a few days, but unfortunately you won't be able to see it yourself. You're dead now, and this is what comes next."""

    marness "Marion. Hutchinson." 
    
    "Marness feels gold spreading through his bones, miracle juice."

    "It's Wheeler now, but she doesn't correct him." 
    
    marion """When you retired from the Foundation, El, we did what we do to all of us who retire; what all of us agree to when we sign up. We gave you some medicine which made you forget. 
    
    As you stepped out of the door for the last time, all the work you did for us — great work, which saved lives — evaporated away, and your cover story sealed over those years became reality. 
    
    That's why you've spent your whole retirement believing that you were a former section chief at the FBI. It's what you wanted, it's what we wanted, it's what you agreed to.

    But you, alone, agreed to something else as well. And you must be starting to remember, now, what that something else was. 
    
    I've injected you with a serum which throws the human aging process into hard reverse, and it affects everything: organs, tissues, memories. You'll be coming up on it soon. 
    
    Remember?"""

    marness "Yes." 
    
    "Marness blinks, remembering, dizzy."
