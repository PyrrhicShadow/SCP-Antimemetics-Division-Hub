    """Lyn Marness is more than ninety years old and hasn't stood at his full height in ten. He was a tower of a man in his prime, two metres tall and built like a boxer. 
    
    Nearly nobody he ever met was able to look him straight in the eye, at least not and tell him \"No\". Illness has gradually eaten away at that over the years. 
    
    He feels as if he lives at the bottom of a deep bath, everybody he ever meets looking down at him from slippery, unscalable walls, none of them able to reach down to help him. 
    
    He's spent his final months crumpled up in bed like a dying spider, changing to a corpse's colour ahead of time. 
    
    It might have been bearable if he'd lost his mind, but he remembers what he used to be: a leader, a powerhouse. 
    
    He used to be able to alter the course of terrible events for the better, to get justice. He used to protect people."""

    unknown "El. You can wake up now."

    """But there's a warm wind through his thin colourless hair and there's direct sunlight coming down on him now, and the heat is filling him up like a tonic. 
    
    He's outside; it's been too long since he was last outside."""

    """When he opens his eyes he sees his lake, the one in the Northwest which he used to have all to himself every summer. 
    
    He's on a boat, his boat, lying on a blanket laid on the deck. A few kilometres away behind them is the little lake house, empty.

    It's perfect. He didn't know he had the strength left to safely leave the hospital, let alone travel this far. 
    
    But if he'd put his mind to it and selected a final moment, this might have been it."""

    unknown "Do you remember me?"

    """Marness looks, with eyes which are strengthening. The woman speaking is seated on the deck beside him, attentive. 
    
    She has a large plastic box full of medical supplies open in front of her, and a light suit jacket laid on the deck beside it, and she has her sleeves rolled up so she can work. 
    
    As he watches, she carefully disposes of a needle."""

    """A dim memory surfaces and starts taking shape. The woman is twice as old now as when he knew her last, and visibly twice as confident. 
    
    It would be difficult to forget her. He taught her everything he— well, everything he could remember at the time. 
    
    He remembers her as a field agent. He remembers sending her through Hell, a fistful of times.""" 
    
    marness "Marion."

    wheeler """El, you died. You died surrounded by grieving family. They loved you very much, and they cried over you. 
    
    The funeral for the fake is in a few days, but unfortunately you won't be able to see it yourself. You're dead now, and this is what comes next."""

    marness "Marion. Hutchinson." 
    
    "Marness feels gold spreading through his bones, miracle juice."

    "It's Wheeler now, but she doesn't correct him." 
    
    wheeler """When you retired from the Foundation, El, we did what we do to all of us who retire; what all of us agree to when we sign up.  We gave you some medicine which made you forget. 
    
    As you stepped out of the door for the last time, all the work you did for us — great work, which saved lives — evaporated away, and your cover story sealed over those years became reality. 
    
    That's why you've spent your whole retirement believing that you were a former section chief at the FBI. 
    
    It's what you wanted, it's what we wanted, it's what you agreed to.

    But you, alone, agreed to something else as well. And you must be starting to remember, now, what that something else was. 
    
    I've injected you with a serum which throws the human aging process into hard reverse, and it affects everything: organs, tissues, memories. 
    
    You'll be coming up on it soon. Remember?"""

    marness "Yes." 
    
    "Marness blinks, remembering, dizzy."

    wheeler """You signed over your final twelve hours to us. 
    
    You asked for a full and happy and well-deserved retirement… but now, for the last day, you work for us again, because of one particular job. 
    
    I have it in writing here, you see? Do you recognise your signature, and mine? I witnessed."""

    marness "Yes."

    wheeler "Do you remember who you are?"

    marness "Doctor Lyn Patrick Marness, of the Foundation. Antimemetics Division founder."

    "Wheeler smiles with relief. It's good to see him again."

    wheeler """We need some memories from you. Memories which nobody else in the world has access to, and which are buried so deeply that we can't extract them without killing you. 
    
    So this afternoon, that's what we're going to do. We're going to extract those memories, and once we're done, you'll be dead."""

    """Marness has already begun to regress to the time when he himself set this wheel in motion. 
    
    He remembers, very clearly, discovering the mystery in his own head, the blank spots which he couldn't explain, and couldn't safely access with any kind of chemical or physical technique. 
    
    He remembers deferring the mystery until now."""

    wheeler "What happened in 1976?"

    """Marness sits up. His skin is beginning to clear and his breathing is improving.

    He feels as if his brain is cleaved in two by a wormhole, such that his eyes are focusing on different time periods. 
    
    In his right eye he sees the lake and the boat he's dying on; in his left he sees a collage of electrifyingly familiar past faces and places. 
    
    Bart Hughes with his grin and thick glasses and baby face, looking like some kid dressed up as a Foundation researcher; 
    
    the original Site 48 crew, great techs but a hopeless excuse for a softball team; 
    
    young Marion with steel-strong nerves and a mind like a laser; suits and lab coats and MTF operatives. 
    
    And everywhere paperwork, and floods of serial numbers.

    He starts to speak. 1976 was the year he founded the division. 
    
    He brainstormed the whole thing in one legendary week, hammering out the science and then distilling the first chemical mnestic with the help of a hand-picked trio of assistants, the first Antimemetics researchers. 
    
    No antimemetic SCPs had even been observed up to that point — the entire operation was a shot in the dark — and yet the team immediately struck gold. 
    
    Passive black holes of information, active predatory infovores, unrememberable worms which covered the human skin like dust mites… contagious bad news, self-sealing secrets, living murders, Chinatowns.

    Wheeler wonders if there might be something more serious awry with Marness' head. His version of events is hopelessly romantic. 
    
    In Wheeler's experience, nobody looks back on Foundation work fondly."""

    marness """But it was all too fast. Special containment procedures take time to develop, much more time than I took. 
    
    The Foundation as a whole acquires about a dozen new SCPs annually. I found that many in one year, essentially single-handedly. 
    
    It was too easy. It was as if I knew it all already, and was just catching up.

    And then… one day I realised I couldn't remember my life before Antimemetics. 
    
    I knew I'd been a Foundation operative for decades prior, that was where I got the authority to start my own division, but there was nothing else there. 
    
    It was a wall in my mind, which even mnestics couldn't get me past. I went to the paper archives and looked at my own personnel file, and…"""

    "Marness trails off. Not because he's forgotten what to say next, it's deliberate. The trailing off is exactly what happened."

    wheeler """You woke up back at your desk half a working day later, remembering nothing. 
    
    You went through the loop a dozen times before someone realised what was happening and broke you out of it."""

    """Wheeler knows all of this. The file still exists, and the antimemetic effect still clouds the back half of it. 
    
    All of this would be over in a second if any of that back half could be read."""

    marness """When I assembled the evidence what I found was… well, a hole. Like a jigsaw with only the edges and corners. 
    
    So I did the only thing I could do, I looked at the shape of the hole. And, together with Bart Hughes and others, I formed a theory.

    This is not the first Antimemetics Division. Before 1976, there was another one. I was part of that division; possibly, I led it. 
    
    Certainly, I am the only known survivor of it. Something happened to that team. Some antimemetic force chewed up and swallowed the idea of the Antimemetics Division itself. 
    
    I was let off lightly; I lived. The rest of those people, whoever they were, however many of them there were, are missing without trace."""

    "Wheeler nods." 
    
    wheeler """This much we know already. I was there when you wrote the note, remember? The question is known. 
    
    It's the answer that we can't get to without killing you. It's the answer that we've waited all these years to get at. 
    
    I'm here to ask you: What. Happened?"""

    "Marness covers his right eye and grimaces, trying. He fails." 
    
    marness """It's not there. You haven't sent me back far enough, there's still that wall there in my head. 
    
    I remember why the question exists, but I don't remember the answer. I need more."""

    "Wheeler swabs his arm, and gives him another ten years."

    """Marness seems like another man once the second X dose takes effect. 
    
    Wrinkles are sliding back up into his face, muscle mass is returning to his limbs, but it takes Wheeler a second to realise the real reason why; she's just booted him back across the field/desk agent transition. 
    
    Marness has regressed a little way past senior management, the realm where most problems were solved by saying the correct words, and into a time where he survived through physical fitness, situational alertness and hands-on experience."""

    """Marness gets to his feet for the first time in years. He scans his surroundings, examining the placid golden lake and the sky and the boat itself. 
    
    He doesn't sit down again. He smooths down his hospital gown, wishing he had a sweater and, separately, some fishing gear. 
    
    He brushes a hand through new, old hair. His sideburns are back."""

    marness """We weren't Foundation at first. The first Antimemetics Division was a U.S. Army project. 
    
    It ran parallel with Manhattan during World War II. We called ourselves the Unthinkables.

    It began as an experiment in advanced propaganda. The objective was to cut through the physical conflict and find a way to rupture the ideological machine, to obliterate the idea of Nazism. 
    
    After two years, enough theory had been developed that the task had been reduced to an engineering problem. 
    
    Another two years, and the engineering problem had been reduced as well, and what we had built was a very special kind of bomb.

    Unfortunately, we didn't understand what we'd built. Back then, we didn't have the mnestics or the shielding that we could use to protect ourselves. 
    
    We didn't understand how far ahead you need to think when you're working with this kind of technology. We got looped. It was textbook. 
    
    We built the unthinkable bomb and test-detonated it… and it worked perfectly.
    
    The bomb destroyed itself, and erased its own successful detonation, and flattened all the knowledge which had gone together to build it. 
    
    We forgot that we had ever built the bomb at all, and started over.

    To our credit, we realised pretty quickly what must have happened. There was a four-year gap in our progress now, and there was no other way to explain it. 
    
    But by the time we put the pieces together the second time, the war was almost over. 
    
    The Nazis had been defeated by conventional means, and the Japanese had been broken by the first atomic bombings. 
    
    So we completed the second antimemetic bomb, and after that, we sat on it."""

    "Marion Wheeler is silent for a long moment."

    wheeler "The U.S. Army was secretly developing antimemetic weaponry as early as the 1940s."

    "Her voice is doubtful."

    marness "We sure were." 
    
    "Marness says this with more than a hint of pride."

    wheeler "Of course, there is no one in the whole world who could back this up."

    marness "That's right." 
    
    "Marness flashes a smile he hasn't flashed in decades." 
    
    marness """You only have my word for it. Cute, huh? 
    
    Still, this is why you resurrected me, isn't it? For the sake of one more good war story. God, I've missed shop talk."""

    wheeler """I resurrected you because I want a very specific question answered. Although I can see that in a way you've already answered it. 
    
    This bomb was the means, wasn't it? The old Antimemetics Division—"""

    marness "—the Unthinkables—"

    wheeler "—bombed themselves. Somehow."

    marness "That's right."

    wheeler "From context, I assume that they knew what they were doing that time. I assume it was not an accident."

    marness "It was not."
