    """Foundation Agent George Barsin is monolithic: nearly two metres tall and rectangular-shouldered, like a Bruce Timm cartoon. 
    
    He is bald, bearded, and immaculately presented. His suit is tailored; there are few which will fit him off the rack.

    He arrives at the Green place first thing after dawn, six o'clock. The address is isolated, an acre or two of ill-maintained scrubland off a spur of a spur of the main highway north out of Ojai.

    Barsin is part of the Foundation's Anomalous Religious Expressions Division. They do cults.

    \"Green\" is not the name of the cult which Barsin is here to confront, but a codename. Barsin doesn't know the real name. 
    
    At the briefing last night, it was explained that there are legitimate security reasons to use codenames instead of true names here, but those reasons were not explained. 
    
    Barsin, no fool, took this to mean that there is some form of cognitohazard surrounding the true names. Or a memory-clouding phenomenon which makes them impossible to record. 
    
    Or — and he's dealt with Foundation research staff for far too many years to not consider this — somebody just straight-up forgot to record the real names, and is trying to cover for themselves.

    If there's an SCP number, he hasn't been told it.""" 

    scene bg house outside 

    """The house is an ugly white sprawl. One storey, wood construction, no two windows alike in design… decaying. There are piles of junk, lumber, rusted vehicle components, drums of filthy green water. 
    
    Willow and sycamore trees are encroaching from two-and-a-half sides, drizzling leaves and seeds and miscellaneous biological gunk all over the roof, clogging the gutters. Through the windows, only closed curtains and blinds are visible. 
    
    The front door is standing ajar."""

    scene bg house inside 

    """Barsin proceeds inside, cautiously. The entrance opens almost directly onto a large lounge/diner/kitchen area. 
    
    The room is darkened, light mostly spilling from the entrance door — Barsin leaves it open — and feeling its way around the edges of the window coverings. 
    
    The place is dirty, and smells of mould. The still air is like an oven, and it's extremely quiet except for the faint, animated sound of someone talking, away down the hall, words not entirely clear."""

    """Barsin goes down the hall, passing a wall decoration which was once a mirror but has been completely painted over in black.

    After a brief search, during which he ascertains that the rest of the house is empty, he comes to the final room. This door is closed, but the focused rambling is coming from inside:"""

    unknown """—at home, it's super easy. I'm going to give you something. An easy two-part project for you to take away, and don't forget alth amnth below.

    """Barsin knocks, loudly, twice.

    The patter stops. Nothing else is heard. Barsin opens the door."""

    """The room is dark, its window blocked with a thick curtain. There's a computer desk in the corner opposite the door, about as cluttered as a desk can realistically get, strewn with partially disassembled hardware, USB keys, chocolate wrappers, scraps of paper, ballpoint pens. 
    
    There's a gaming mouse, unable to move for junk. There's a good-quality video camera setup, a monitor, video feeds on the monitor, dust."""

    """There's a cheap, skeletal swivel chair in front of the monitor and a young man of about twenty slouched uncomfortably in the chair. He is skinny, with discoloured, pale skin which Barsin thinks could be caused by malnutrition. 
    
    He has what was at one point a stylish, fashionable haircut but is now in some disrepair, and when he turns around Barsin sees that he has dark rings around his eyes. It looks as if he hasn't slept in a year. 
    
    He reeks. The room is filled with that odour, almost thick enough to see.

    In the same way that the anomalous viral/religious phenomenon — the cult, gathering around and above this young man like an anvil cloud — is named \"Green\", he himself is named \"Red\"."""

    Red stumbles back, crouching. He finds his footing swiftly. Froth is developing at the corners of his mouth, mixing with blood. 
    
    Scrabbling around the junk on the floor, he puts his hand on a soldering iron.

    As Red comes forward again, Barsin wastes a critical split second trying to trace the iron's cable, to figure out whether it's plugged in and hot or not. 
    
    It's not, but that's enough distraction that Red gets right up there, driving the iron up into Barsin's gut with both hands.""" 
    
    """There's an electronic screech and a spark of orange light; the iron holes Barsin's shirt but skitters off his abdomen, opening a long tear. There's bare skin underneath. 
    
    His shield is invisible, partly mythical, and protects his seemingly exposed head just as well as the rest of him.

    Barsin takes Red in a headlock. Some haphazard kicking ensues, less well-choreographed. Red has a demon's energy behind him but Barsin has, to be blunt, arrived prepared. 
    
    In a few more moves, Red is disarmed, stunned, flat on his back and good for nothing.

    Barsin takes stock. The number of genuine, fight-for-your-life fights he's been in is still in single digits. 
    
    This one ranks about in the middle. Fifteen seconds of activity; both of them made mistakes. A learning experience."""

    Very effective compared to the generic self-help-book-and-walled-compound model. You get one point for originality, out of ten. 
    
    But we predicted it decades back and we had the containment procedures ready to go. We have people at the streaming services. 
    
    As I speak, we're locking you out of your account. We're using your own channels to distribute inoculation codes."""

    """He reaches inside his jacket — where he has a perfectly serviceable gun, which he elected to leave where it is for this confrontation — and produces a device not unlike an ophthalmologist's scope. 
    
    He kneels, lifts Red's right eyelid and aims the scope at it, projecting a brilliant white spot of light which bathes the entire eye and causes it to lock open. 
    
    Almost all of Red's musculature locks up as well, effectively pinning him to the floor. His teeth clench."""

    There's a crack like ribs being forced apart. And the youth screams. 
    
    It doesn't sound like Red. It's a full-body scream, anguished and hopeless and as loud as he's physically able to make it. 
    
    It comes up from his belly and goes on, flat out, until he runs out of breath and gasps and does it again, arching his back and clawing at the floor. 
    
    After the second full breath he cools down to a sobbing wail."""

    "The youth vehemently agrees."

    barsin """Something has gone wrong, and that thing, that horrific thing which went wrong, has found you and abducted you and replaced you. 
    
    It's out here now, using your skin as a finger puppet, walking you around, making you talk. Replicating. That nightmare you're having is being had by a hundred thousand people right now. That's the bad news. 
    
    The good news is that we caught you. And I can still see you in there. And there's good chance that we can get you out."""

    The more you think about the spiral, the more you realise you can't think about anything but the spiral."""

    "The youth seems to have nothing to say to this. His breathing stabilises."

    barsin """Your thoughts are slowed. The spirals fill you up, recursively, like ice crystals, until you can't move. 
    
    Your brain knows it's being poisoned. Even though you're blind, you feel a reflexive need to look away or block out what you're seeing. 
    
    A long enough exposure is fatal."""

    """There is a long, heavy pause, during which Barsin does nothing but shine poisonous light into the young man's eye, while studying that brightly illuminated eye himself, tracking the progress of the ocular response, waiting for a particular tell. 
    
    It's not a clear-cut thing; there's a small amount of guesswork. He waits until he's sure. 
    
    Finally, he releases the button on the scope, shutting it off.

    The youth is now completely inert."""

    Because you, my man, are an intelligent, creative human being, and Red is…"""

    He has seen some photographs of what takes place in homes occupied by Red's appalling messages. He's heard a strictly limited amount of highly redacted audio.

    Dispassionate people make better field decisions, that's the rule he was always taught. But remaining dispassionate is harder on some days than others."""

    barsin "…a piece of shit."

    """Barsin potters around the room for a little while, taking a closer look at some of the computer hardware. 
    
    Nothing notable there, although he finds a stand for the soldering iron. There's also a narrow camp bed in the room, with a bedraggled sleeping bag. 
    
    He clears the sleeping bag away and loads the youth onto the camp bed, in a recovery position. 
    
    He pulls the curtain open. It's an obnoxiously sunny day, and the Sun is aimed right in through that window."""

    """Finally, Barsin picks up the swivel chair and settles into it, on the far side of the room, where he can keep an eye on his patient. 
    
    He pulls a Foundation-issued phone from his pocket, along with a horrendously tangled pair of cheap earbuds, which he begins to untangle.

    He relaxes into his monologue. It's not as if anybody is listening."""

    You know what the original plan was when we found out about you? Orbital laser cannon to the top of the head. 
    
    We can do that, my man. From time to time. Your house would be a circle of scorched timber with you a burnt marshmallow at the middle of it. 
    
    That's our latest methodology for dealing with virulent, single-culpability memetic anomalies. We do it at arm's length, at the longest possible distance, unblinkingly and unfeelingly, and to hell with the details. 
    
    It's brutal. Impersonal. Very expensive in orbital laser maintenance. 
    
    We say to ourselves that it's effective. Maybe it is. I'm not at that level. I don't get to see the statistics."""
