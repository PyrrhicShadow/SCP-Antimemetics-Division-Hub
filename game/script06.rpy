    """Who the {i}fuck{/i} infiltrates a senior Foundation official's home, while they're home?

    Marion Wheeler lives deep in coniferous forest, a long drive from the nearest major city and a long drive in the opposite direction from Site 41. 
    
    It's late, last thing, and she's reading in bed when she hears the muffled, unmistakeable click of her front door being unlocked. 
    
    She looks up, and stares blankly at the wall for a second while listening to soft footsteps moving into the hallway.

    She marks her place and reaches for her Foundation-issued phone. 
    
    She has no permanent security staff at home — the Division is understaffed and trained operatives are in much more serious need on Site — but the building and grounds have beefy electronic countermeasures. 
    
    They, she discovers, have all been disabled, along with the sensors and cameras. She was not notified that this had happened. 
    
    Whoever did it had a valid code."""

    "Who, though?"

    """The Foundation has enemies. 
    
    True, the list of credible, motivated enemies is surprisingly short, and the list of groups stupid enough to try to kill or capture someone at her level is shorter. 
    
    But it's far from empty, and it's not actually so hard a feat; not too many people below O5 level are privileged to travel in motorcades. T
    
    he real trick, the impossible trick, is to avoid unholy retaliation. 
    
    But what if you really think you can? What if you've decided it's worth it?

    Wheeler triggers the silent alarm. She sets her phone back down on the nightstand and collects her gun. 
    
    She rolls out of bed, tucks a few pillows in her place, moves silently to her bedroom door and stands beside it, listening and thinking.

    This door, her bedroom door, can't be opened silently. It creaks like hell, so if she goes through it she'll have to be ready to draw attention. 
    
    There's an attic, but access is out there on the landing and, again, can't be operated silently. 
    
    There's no alternate route to ground level other than jumping from the window, and someone has to be covering it. 
    
    Even if she landed in the bushes alive, she'd still have to break the perimeter with a sprained ankle.

    A better question than \"Who?\" is \"How many?\" She may already be straight-up dead, simply due to numbers. 
    
    If the attackers tread cautiously and try to flush her out, she figures she can {i}Home Alone{/i} her way through perhaps eight of them before running out of luck. 
    
    If they rush the second floor and have armor she might be overwhelmed by as few as two, even with the staircase acting as a choke point. 
    
    All of this, naturally, assumes that the attackers aren't anomalous. 
    
    If they are, and they're not in the, say, thirty percent of anomalies which can be neutralised simply by shooting them in the centre mass and head, she may be fundamentally helpless even after the response team shows up. 
    
    Which will be, at best, ten minutes from now."""

    """A creaking. This damned house. Someone is coming up the stairs, making no effort to be quiet about it.

    She knows there are knitting needles downstairs in the lounge and knives, good ones, in the kitchen.

    It seems like the man's trying to say something as he comes in, but he only gets as far as \"I— whulp,\" and it's done. 
    
    He's flat on his face, cheek pressed into deep cream carpet, with Wheeler on his back pinning both his wrists with her knees. 
    
    She sights urgently back down the stairs for a second; there's no one there. She prods him in his other cheek with the muzzle of the gun."""

    He wears discreet platinum jewellery: a wristwatch, cufflinks and a ring.
