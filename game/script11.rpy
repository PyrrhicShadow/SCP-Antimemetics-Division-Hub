    """Who the {i}fuck{/i} infiltrates a senior Foundation official's home, while they're home?

    Marion Wheeler lives deep in coniferous forest, a long drive from the nearest major city and a long drive in the opposite direction from Site 41. 
    
    It's late, last thing, and she's reading in bed when she hears the muffled, unmistakeable click of her front door being unlocked. 
    
    She looks up, and stares blankly at the wall for a second while listening to soft footsteps moving into the hallway.

    She marks her place and reaches for her Foundation-issued phone. 
    
    She has no permanent security staff at home — the Division is understaffed and trained operatives are in much more serious need on Site — but the building and grounds have beefy electronic countermeasures. 
    
    They, she discovers, have all been disabled, along with the sensors and cameras. She was not notified that this had happened. 
    
    Whoever did it had a valid code."""

    "Who, though?"

    """The Foundation has enemies. 
    
    True, the list of credible, motivated enemies is surprisingly short, and the list of groups stupid enough to try to kill or capture someone at her level is shorter. 
    
    But it's far from empty, and it's not actually so hard a feat; not too many people below O5 level are privileged to travel in motorcades. T
    
    he real trick, the impossible trick, is to avoid unholy retaliation. 
    
    But what if you really think you can? What if you've decided it's worth it?

    Wheeler triggers the silent alarm. She sets her phone back down on the nightstand and collects her gun. 
    
    She rolls out of bed, tucks a few pillows in her place, moves silently to her bedroom door and stands beside it, listening and thinking.

    This door, her bedroom door, can't be opened silently. It creaks like hell, so if she goes through it she'll have to be ready to draw attention. 
    
    There's an attic, but access is out there on the landing and, again, can't be operated silently. 
    
    There's no alternate route to ground level other than jumping from the window, and someone has to be covering it. 
    
    Even if she landed in the bushes alive, she'd still have to break the perimeter with a sprained ankle.

    A better question than \"Who?\" is \"How many?\" She may already be straight-up dead, simply due to numbers. 
    
    If the attackers tread cautiously and try to flush her out, she figures she can {i}Home Alone{/i} her way through perhaps eight of them before running out of luck. 
    
    If they rush the second floor and have armor she might be overwhelmed by as few as two, even with the staircase acting as a choke point. 
    
    All of this, naturally, assumes that the attackers aren't anomalous. 
    
    If they are, and they're not in the, say, thirty percent of anomalies which can be neutralised simply by shooting them in the centre mass and head, she may be fundamentally helpless even after the response team shows up. 
    
    Which will be, at best, ten minutes from now."""

    """A creaking. This damned house. Someone is coming up the stairs, making no effort to be quiet about it. 
    
    A soft tread, though. As if they removed their shoes. 
    
    Just one of them? That barely makes sense."""

    """With five seconds' grace, Wheeler casts around the dark room for a second weapon. 
    
    She knows there are knitting needles downstairs in the lounge and knives, good ones, in the kitchen. 
    
    But she can't get to them. It's too late. The door's opening. 
    
    It seems like the man's trying to say something as he comes in, but he only gets as far as \"I— whulp,\" and it's done. 
    
    He's flat on his face, cheek pressed into deep cream carpet, with Wheeler on his back pinning both his wrists with her knees. 
    
    She sights urgently back down the stairs for a second; there's no one there. She prods him in his other cheek with the muzzle of the gun.""" 
    
    wheeler "You speak, you die. You try to move, you die." 
    
    """She glances at the windows, checks the stairs again, listens intently. There's no sound. There's nothing to be seen.

    The man is fifty, and lanky. He wears an expensive dark suit, tailored to his build. 
    
    He has angular features, thick, greying hair and rimless spectacles, now quite possibly bent out of shape by their sudden impact with the floor. 
    
    He wears discreet platinum jewellery: a wristwatch, cufflinks and a ring.

    The two of them halt like that, a tableau. 
    
    He makes no attempt to move, although he does look askance at Wheeler, as best he can given his dislodged glasses."""

    wheeler "Where are the others?"

    unknown "It's just me, Marion."

    wheeler "Who are you?"

    "He says nothing for a moment, but his expression slowly, subtly drops."
    
    unknow "I, ah. Well. Well, it really happened, didn't it? I always wondered."

    wheeler "Who are you?"

    unknown """There is a monster which follows you around and eats your memories. 
    
    SCP-4987. You drip-feed it inconsequential trivia so it doesn't go after anything important. 
    
    You watch game shows. The book you were reading just now. On your nightstand. It's a trivia book. 
    
    Right?"""

    """Wheeler says nothing to confirm or deny this, although it is true. At feeding time the entity manifests like a bright gold-white spot in the corner of her eye. 
    
    It's gone now.

    She's already put the rest of it together. It is all mind-bogglingly, insultingly obvious."""

    "With a well-suppressed but still detectable note of dismay, she asks:" 
    
    wheeler "What's your name?"

    unknow "Adam."
    
    adam "Adam Wheeler."

    scene bg scp office

    """Obviously, she has the man detained.

    She instructs her people to interrogate him — lightly — and to run deep background research on every word he utters, while for her part she stands far back from the investigation to avoid contamination. 
    
    She resists the urge to interfere, particularly to visit \"Adam\" and personally demand answers. 
    
    She goes to her office, curls up on the couch there and tries to catch some sleep, but doesn't succeed in any real sense."""

    """Seven hours later a Foundationer knocks on her office door, bringing an inch-thick block of printouts and a paralysingly strong cup of coffee. 
    
    Wheeler takes the drink first, accepting it as a kind of authentication step before letting the man in. 
    
    She moves back to the couch and sits hunched over the drink for warmth, inhaling its fumes.

    The man settles heavily into a chair opposite. 
    
    He is a misleadingly stocky, perpetually unshaven individual, somewhere just shy of forty, and inarguably the most dangerous person on the Site. 
    
    He is the Division's physical fitness and combat instructor and the leader of their solitary Mobile Task Force. 
    
    His name is Alex Gauss."""
    
    gauss "They, uh,figured I should be the one to present their results. Even though I didn't research one line of it. 'Cause we 'get along'. Their words. Personally, I don't see it."

    wheeler "Who is he?" 

    "Gauss opens the first page of the report, more for show than anything, then closes it again." 
    
    gauss """He's your husband. Every word checks out. 
    
    There is limitless physical evidence. Half of the Division knows him socially, including me. 
    
    I credit your diligence and adherence to protocol, but the bottom line is that SCP-4987 got hungry."""

    """Wheeler nods. This assessment matches her own, pieced together overnight from gut reactions and analysis of the plain facts. Where the hell else did her name come from? She wasn't born \"Wheeler\". But she had to get independent verification."""

    wheeler "Has this happened before?"

    gauss "No."

    wheeler "Could it happen again?"

    "Gauss shrugs." 
    
    gauss "You would know better than anyone."

    wheeler """I would. I do. 
    
    And I can tell you this: 
        
        I have SCP-4987 trained to follow me at my heel. I feed it according to a strict regimen, it eats only the memories I say it's okay to eat. 
        
        A rapidly progressive, universally fatal memory parasite made chronic and then domesticated. 
        
        And now, what, it suddenly breaks training? 
        
        That adds up?"""

    gauss """If you say it doesn't add up, it doesn't add up. 
    
    But speaking from field experience, anything can happen twice."""

    """Wheeler has waited long enough, and takes a long pull from the coffee. 
    
    She stares into the coiling steam, as if trying to see the future.""" 
    
    wheeler """But who is he?
    
    At this point, you know him better than I do. 
    
    What's he like? Do you like him?"""

    "Wheeler looks him in the eye." 
    
    wheeler "Tell me your personal impression of Adam Wheeler. Direct order."

    gauss "…He's a nice enough guy."

    wheeler "'Nice enough'?"

    "Gauss clicks his tongue." 
    
    gauss """I don't like him. Personally. All that much. 
    
    We're civil. But he will always be a little bit too smug, and a little bit too clever. 
    
    He just… grates. 
    
    Would I throw someone in a cell for that? No."""

    wheeler "Do I like him?"

    gauss "You—" 
    
    """Gauss begins, then stops. He looks away. 
    
    And over time, a soft smile develops on his face, one which Wheeler doesn't recall ever seeing before, not in a working relationship going back years."""

    Adam Wheeler's life spent touring, playing, lecturing and occasionally conducting, writing and composing is documented in exhaustive, pointless detail. 
    
    He withstands background checks and surveillance, and consistently demonstrates himself to represent zero risk of leak. 
    
    He eventually receives the extremely low clearance level normally granted to long-term Foundation-external partners of Foundationers. 
    
    They get married. She takes his name, which she, reading, considers faintly unrealistic.

    It's only when they start over from \"What's your name?\" with a brand new interviewer for the fourth time that he finally gets it: they don't like him, and they don't care what he thinks his name is. 
    
    They're trying to grind him down, until he can't think, until he's just dust particles they can sift through for data.

    He reacts badly to this realisation. 
    
    He asks for his wife, and asks for his wife, and they ignore him, and they ignore him, and she persistently fails to appear, until it becomes a cold form of torture.
