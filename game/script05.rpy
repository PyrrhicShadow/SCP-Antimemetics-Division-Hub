    """Marion Wheeler is curled in the corner of Site 41's main freight elevator, descending, clutching a shiny red ray gun almost as long as she is tall. 
    
    The gun has a two-tined prong instead of a barrel and its stock is a weirdly asymmetrical mass of pipework, more like a Swiss watch or a small intestinal tract than a weapon. 
    
    The gun is SCP-7381, and it comes from a long-dead planet — not too distant a planet, when all's said and done — which conventional astronomy has yet to observe.

    A tornado of violence and destruction is tearing through Site 41 and through the minds of everybody working at Site 41. 
    
    Ceilings are being brought down, the site pharmacy is a sucking hole at the side of the building. 
    
    The armoury is buried; that's why she had to go through Area 09 and is now toting anomalous weaponry instead. 
    
    The Antimemetics Division operatives she meets in the corridors are all broken; some of them curled up and raving while their minds evaporate and they die one memory at a time, some infected with a collection of ideas which compel them to shout guttural phrases in strange languages, and to procure blades — never guns — and work on those demented victims, and each other, and themselves.

    Wheeler doesn't recognise any of the people. Their faces are all wrong, torn up with hatred and misery and vindictive glee. 
    
    She's been trying to avoid fighting, but she's had to kill one man in self-defence. Fired at his heart, SCP-7381 simply erased a half-metre-wide cylinder of matter, removing his upper torso and lower jaw. 
    
    He fell to the ground in four pieces. SCP-7381's beam is invisible, silent and recoilless. It was like using a child's toy gun.

    Wheeler is petrified, but more than that, angry.""" 
    
    wheeler "This is too much." 
    
    "She says this, out loud, willing her heart rate back under control."
    
    wheeler "I can't deal with this. I shouldn't have to deal with this. It's my fucking first day!"
